While I was originally trying to capture a photo of the robins that usually frequent the backyard, I decided to take a few test shots of Bella as she ran around the yard (more than likley scaring off any birds from arriving to begin with). This photo demonstraights my ability to take great photos of subjects in action, even if that subject happens to be a very small dog.</p>
