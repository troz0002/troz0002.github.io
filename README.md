For my website portfolio, I started off by making my prototype for what I wanted the site to include during my User Experience Design Class. I decided that I only wanted to showcase my best work on the site, and so I decided to have slots for 2 of my best works in different genres of design, such as web design, photography, and graphic design. Alongside these images of my work would be a should the description of how the content was created and what skills it demonstrates from me. Walking into this project, the biggest challenge for me was time. Due to the fact that this was the last of all my assignments that would be due, it was the last one that I started, and because of that, I had a smaller than the preferable amount of time to work. I solved this problem by using Bootstrap, as I knew it would be a lot quicker for me to simply use a framework rather than to build the entire website from scratch. Other than that, the only real struggle that I faced during the development of the website was writing all of the content on it, which I just found to be very tedious. I don't know if doing so was actually a requirement of the assignment, but I wanted my portfolio to actually funcation as one. Overall, the biggest thing I learned from this final assignment is how useful Bootstrap can be when it comes to creating a great site quickly.
